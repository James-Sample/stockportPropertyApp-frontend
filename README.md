# About the Project

I wanted to create a Right Move style property app specifically for my local area (Stockport). I decided to go for a MERN stack application, utilising technologies such as:
•	JavaScript/React
•	Node/Express
•	HTML/CSS
•	Mongoose/MongoDB
•	AWS S3 Bucket
•	Google Maps
•	NPM

You can clone the project frontend from this repo:
•	https://github.com/James-Sample/stockportPropertyApp-frontend 

And the backend from:
•	https://github.com/James-Sample/stockportPropertyApp-backend 

To intiailise the project run the following commands in both repos: 
•	npm install
•	npm start

Remember, you will need to add your own details for the environment variables which will include:
•	A link to a mongoDB database
•	Details for an S3 bucket
•	The location of your backend
•	S default image URL for property uploads

The app displays a number of properties and their information hosted on the database, as well as an uploaded image of the property:

There are filtering options at the top to allow filtering by postcode and title, as well as the ability to sort by price and number of bedrooms

The add property form is displayed below:

I also included an interactive Iframe from Google Maps which highlights the different postcode areas of Stockport:

I mainly focused on functionality with this app, and if i had more time I would have incorporated more testing and spent more time on styling and reactiveness. Any comments would be much appreciated, thanks for reading!
